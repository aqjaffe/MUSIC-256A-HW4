# MUSIC-256A-HW4

In this project, you play a villain flying through space, destroying planets as you pass by them. However, you can only destroy planets that are the same color as your laser, and you change this color by singing different pitches into your microphone. As planets fly by you, hear the doppler shift of their screams!
