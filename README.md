# MUSIC-256A-HW4

This project simulates a flight through space. Stars zoom by to give the effect of motion, and the user can press the up and down arrow keys to change the velocity. Later, there will be implemented audio features like hearing the Doppler effect as you fly past various objects.

Created as Homework 4 for MUSIC 256A at Stanford CCRMA. Created using VisualStudio and openFrameworks.
